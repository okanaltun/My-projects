# My-projects

Hi, I am a data enthusiast who works as a data scientist for 2 years now. It is not possible for me to share the fruitful code practices I have done during work due to data privacy, but I enjoy working on problems outside of my job to stretch muscles and will be sharing some of those here. Hope that you enjoy!
